# Sleeping-Cell-KPI-Data
The repository contains three tables (.csv file) of network key performance indicator (KPI) data for the sleeping cell detection.

The sleeping cells are one kind of special anomaly cells in mobile networks, and are generally defined as cells that go into outage or perform poorly to provide degraded service for users without triggering alarms. Sleeping cells are generated with complex formation reasons including software and hardware failures, and can only recover after manual intervention like repair actions.

We collect and store three cells' KPI data of 11 days from Sep 3, 2018, consisting of the corresponding data of 36 KPIs for each cell, as shown in the .csv files. Moreover, we note that the information indicators such as cell ID and so on are not regarded as KPIs.

The data is used for the papers as follows:
